# Filtered Search Suggestion

<!-- STORY -->

## Usage

The filtered search suggestion component is a wrapper around `GlDropdownItem`, which registers
suggestions in a top-level suggestion list:

```js
<gl-filtered-search-suggestion-list>
  <gl-filtered-search-suggestion value="foo">Example suggestion</gl-filtered-search-suggestion>
  <gl-filtered-search-suggestion value="bar">Example suggestion 2</gl-filtered-search-suggestion>
</gl-filtered-search-suggestion-list>
```
