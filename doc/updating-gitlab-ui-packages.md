# Updating GitLab Packages

When a change to GitLab UI is made, it will not be reflected in other projects until the package is updated.

## Pajamas
For [Pajamas](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com) updates, we are using [Renovate GitLab Bot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/renovate-gitlab-bot) to automate updates.

Merge requests generated by the bot are assigned to two people from the [assignees list](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/renovate-gitlab-bot/-/blob/main/config.js).

In the case of `patch` and `minor` releases, Renovate GitLab Bot will automatically merge the update once the generated MR is approved. At this time, the changes should be viewable on the Pajamas site.

In the case of `major` releases (breaking changes), the MR will need to be merged manually.

## Gitlab

[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab) also uses [Renovate GitLab Bot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/renovate-gitlab-bot). Merge requests generated by the bot are assigned to two people from the [assignees list](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/renovate-gitlab-bot/-/blob/main/config.js). However, every update must be merged manually by a maintainer.

## Customer Portal

The [Customer Portal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com) is updated using [Renovate GitLab Bot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/renovate-gitlab-bot) as well. The MRs are managed by the customer portal assignee(s) listed in the [assignees list](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/renovate-gitlab-bot/-/blob/main/config.js).

## Status Page

The [Status Page Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/status-page) must be updated manually.
